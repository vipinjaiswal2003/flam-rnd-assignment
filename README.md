# Flam R&D Intern Assignment – Android + OpenCV C++ + OpenGL ES + TypeScript Web

This repository contains an implementation template of the **Real-Time Edge Detection Viewer** assignment.

It includes:
- Android app with CameraX, JNI, OpenCV C++ processing (Canny), and an OpenGL ES 2.0 pipeline.
- TypeScript web viewer that displays a static processed frame with overlay text.
- Clear structure you can import into Android Studio and extend.

> You MUST configure the OpenCV Android SDK path locally for native code to build correctly.
